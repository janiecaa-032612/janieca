            <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It provides the structure and layout of a webpage by using tags and elements to define content such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, and more.</p>

            <p>HTML is the backbone of all websites and works alongside other technologies like CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity). It is essential for anyone looking to get into web development, as every web page on the internet is built using HTML.</p>

            <h3>Key HTML Concepts:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tags:</strong> HTML elements are wrapped in tags, such as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for headings, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> for paragraphs, and <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for links.</li>
                <li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Tags may also contain attributes, such as <code>class</code>, <code>id</code>, and <code>src</code>, which provide additional information about elements.</li>
                <li><strong>Elements:</strong> HTML elements consist of opening and closing tags and the content in between. For example, <code>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code> is a paragraph element.</li>
            </ul>
